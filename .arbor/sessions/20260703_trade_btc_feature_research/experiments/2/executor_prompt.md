## Git Isolation

Work in the assigned experiment branch/worktree. Do not switch back to the main repository for implementation or evaluation.

## Research Idea

**ID**: 2
**Hypothesis**:
Mechanism: bid-expanded joint win-and-fill classifier r(b,X)=P(correct and winner_low<=b|X) replacing the q times Gc independence decomposition
Hypothesis: Gc calibration drift shows correctness and fill depth are conditionally coupled; directly estimating their joint event should rank bids by realized EV more stably across months
Observable: improve robust w1-w4 sum_pnl and remain above the node-1 base-Gc policy on both untouched w5-w6 weeks without using B_test
Conflicts: node 1.1 improved PnL but degraded Gc Brier after w2; joint-event supervision removes the unstable conditional division

## Evaluation Info

- **Evaluation command (B_dev)**: `rtk python C:\Users\ROG\Desktop\crypto_engine_version1/.arbor/sessions/20260703_trade_btc_feature_research/run_feature_research.py`
- **Evaluation command (B_test, do not use for routine experiments)**: `disabled until robust milestone`
- **Dataset info**: rolling expanding weekly folds w1-w6; w1-w4 selection, w5-w6 untouched gate, final month protected
- **Baseline score**: 221.78
- **Current trunk score**: 221.78

Use B_dev for final experiment scoring. Do NOT use B_test.

## Insights From Prior Experiments

- ROOT: Children findings: [1, done, score=266.3] Children findings: [1.1, done, score=290.3] Trade-conditioned monotone Gc increased PnL on all six weeks (tune 290.31, holdout 138.58), but Gc Brier improved only on w1-w2 and degraded on w3-w6; the PnL mechanism is robust while calibration drift remains unresolved.

## Instructions

1. Understand the code before editing.
2. Implement the idea faithfully.
3. Run quick checks to ensure the new logic is active.
4. Iterate on implementation bugs.
5. Run the B_dev evaluation when credible.
6. Report Changes, Baseline vs Result, Score, and Insight. The score must be the absolute primary metric, not a delta.

Save results to `results/2-<brief-description>/`.
