## Codebase

Working directory: C:\Users\ROG\Desktop\crypto_engine_version1

## Git Isolation

Work in the assigned experiment branch/worktree. Do not switch back to the main repository for implementation or evaluation.

## Research Idea

**ID**: 1.2
**Hypothesis**:
Mechanism: High-fill feasible-set scan over Gc floors 0.90 to 0.95 with EV abstention
Hypothesis: Constraining the action set rather than merely ranking all bids can increase realized winner fills, but must be selected by rolling robust PnL to control higher forced-loser cost
Observable: At least three of w1-w4 beat their anchor, w5 and w6 remain positive, and submitted realized correct-fill approaches 0.85
Conflicts: G0 found a 0.1449 optimistic fill gap; this tests whether a nominally higher floor overcomes it

## Evaluation Info

- **Evaluation command (B_dev)**: `rtk python C:\Users\ROG\Desktop\crypto_engine_version1/.arbor/sessions/20260706_gc_market_stop_all/run_experiments.py --node 1.2 --split dev`
- **Evaluation command (B_test, do not use for routine experiments)**: `rtk python C:\Users\ROG\Desktop\crypto_engine_version1/.arbor/sessions/20260706_gc_market_stop_all/run_experiments.py --node 1.2 --split test`
- **Dataset info**: w1-w4 tune; w5-w6 untouched gate; frozen B_test 2026-04-11..2026-05-10
- **Baseline score**: 42.43
- **Current trunk score**: 42.43

Use B_dev for final experiment scoring. Do NOT use B_test.

## Insights From Prior Experiments

- ROOT: Children findings: [1, pending] Children findings: [1.1, done, score=42.43] Exact raw_tree_blend/0.85/0.02 replay reproduced 42.43; submitted correct-fill realized 0.7176 versus modeled 0.8625, confirming a 0.1449 optimism gap.
- 1: Children findings: [1.1, done, score=42.43] Exact raw_tree_blend/0.85/0.02 replay reproduced 42.43; submitted correct-fill realized 0.7176 versus modeled 0.8625, confirming a 0.1449 optimism gap.

## Instructions

1. Understand the code before editing.
2. Implement the idea faithfully.
3. Run quick checks to ensure the new logic is active.
4. Iterate on implementation bugs.
5. Run the B_dev evaluation when credible.
6. Report Changes, Baseline vs Result, Score, and Insight. The score must be the absolute primary metric, not a delta.

Save results to `results/1.2-<brief-description>/`.
